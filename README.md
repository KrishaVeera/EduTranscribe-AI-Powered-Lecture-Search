# EduTranscribe-AI-Powered-Lecture-Search

This project focuses on creating an **AI-powered Knowledge Base** using **AWS services**, which allows users to upload audio lecture, transcribe it into text, store it in Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, and query the information using Amazon Bedrock.

By leveraging **Amazon Transcribe, OpenSearch Serverless, and Bedrock**, this system enables efficient retrieval of lecture teachings. 

## **Technologies Used**

- **Amazon S3** – Storage for lecture audio and transcription files.
- **Amazon Transcribe** – Converts audio files into text format.
- **Amazon OpenSearch Serverless** – Stores and indexes text for retrieval.
- **Amazon IAM** – Provides controlled access to AWS resources.
- **Amazon Bedrock** – Enables AI-based querying over the knowledge base.
